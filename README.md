# SOLID Principles in C#

This repository contains my practice implementations of the **SOLID** design principles in C#.

## What’s Done So Far

- **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**  
  Code samples demonstrating the Single Responsibility Principle are in the `SRP/` folder.

- **OCP (Open/Closed Principle)**  
  Code samples demonstrating the Open/Closed Principle are in the `OCP/` folder.

- **LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)**  
  Code samples demonstrating the Liskov Substitution Principle are in the `LSP/` folder.

## What’s Next

I will continue adding examples for the remaining principles:  
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  

The README will be updated regularly as new content is added.

## About SOLID Principles

**SOLID** is an acronym for five design principles that help write clean, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented code:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle  
- **O**pen/Closed Principle  
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle  
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle  
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle
