# SOLID Principles in C#

This repository contains my practice implementations of the SOLID design principles in C#.

## What’s Done So Far

- **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**  
  Folder `SRP/` contains code demonstrating the Single Responsibility Principle.

- **OCP (Open/Closed Principle)**  
  Folder `OCP/` contains code demonstrating the Open/Closed Principle.

## What’s Next

I will continue adding examples for the remaining principles:  
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

I plan to update this README as I add more content.

## About SOLID Principles

SOLID stands for:  
- Single Responsibility  
- Open/Closed  
- Liskov Substitution  
- Interface Segregation  
- Dependency Inversion

These principles help write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
