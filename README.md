# SOLID Principles in C#

This repository contains clean, practical implementations of the **SOLID** design principles using **C#**. Each principle is demonstrated with real-world-inspired examples to help understand and apply them effectively in object-oriented programming.

## 🧱 What Are SOLID Principles?

**SOLID** is an acronym for five principles that improve code quality, flexibility, and maintainability:

- **S** – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
- **O** – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
- **L** – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
- **I** – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
- **D** – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## ✅ Implemented Principles

| Principle | Description | Folder |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **SRP** | A class should have only one reason to change | [`/SRP`](./SRP) |
| **OCP** | Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification | [`/OCP`](./OCP) |
| **LSP** | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types | [`/LSP`](./LSP) |
| **ISP** | Clients should not depend on interfaces they do not use | [`/ISP`](./ISP) |
| **DIP** | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules | [`/DIP`](./DIP) |

Each folder contains:
- ✨ A real-world analogy  
- 🧑‍💻 Clean C# implementation  
- 📄 Well-commented code  
- ✅ Console output for demonstration
